<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a re-implementation of XAI-AGE in pytorch, based on the PNET architecture: https://github.com/vanallenlab/pnet.


**Biologically informed deep learning for explainable epigenetic clocks**

Aging is defined by steady buildup of damage and is a risk factor for chronic diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation may play a role in organismal aging, but whether they are active drivers or consequences is unknown. Epigenetic clocks, based on DNA methylation, accurately determine a person's biological age. In the past years, a number of accurate epigenetic clocks were developed, and their function and an overview of the field is summarized by Seale et al.. 
         
Here we present **XAI-AGE**, which is a biologically informed, explainable deep neural network model for accurate biological age prediction across many tissues. We show that this approach can identify differentially activated pathways and biological processes from the latent layers of the neural network, and is based on a recently published explainable model used in cancer research, called PNET by Elmarakeby et al..
